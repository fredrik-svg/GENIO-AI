# Security Summary

## CodeQL Analysis Results

The CodeQL security scanner identified 5 alerts, all of which are **false positives**. Below is the analysis:

### Alert: Clear-text logging of sensitive data

**Status**: FALSE POSITIVE (Safe)

**Locations**:
1. `scripts/health_check.py` lines 26, 30, 32
2. `genio_ai.py` lines 566, 569

**Explanation**: 
The security scanner flags these locations because they contain string operations with variables whose names include the word "password" (e.g., `MQTT_PASSWORD`). However, upon inspection:

- These locations only log **environment variable names** (e.g., "MQTT_PASSWORD", "PORCUPINE_ACCESS_KEY")
- They **never** log the actual sensitive values
- When environment variables are set, their values are masked with asterisks
- When environment variables are missing, we only report the variable name so users know what to set

**Example**:
```python
# This prints: "❌ Miljövariabel MQTT_PASSWORD saknas"
# NOT: "❌ Miljövariabel MQTT_PASSWORD saknas: actual_secret_password"
print(f"❌ Miljövariabel {var_name} saknas")
```

**Mitigation**: 
- Added extensive comments in the code explaining that only variable names are logged
- Values are always masked when present
- This is necessary functionality to help users configure the application

## Security Improvements Implemented

### 1. Input Validation
- Text sanitization for TTS to prevent command injection
- Configuration validation at startup
- Environment variable existence checks

### 2. Timeout Protection
- TTS process timeout (30 seconds) to prevent hanging
- MQTT connection timeout with retry logic
- External process timeouts

### 3. Secure Communication
- MQTT over TLS/SSL (port 8883)
- Certificate validation enabled
- Secure credential handling via environment variables

### 4. Error Handling
- Specific exception handling (not generic `Exception`)
- Safe error messages that don't expose sensitive information
- Proper resource cleanup with try-finally blocks

### 5. Logging Security
- Sensitive data never logged (passwords, access keys)
- Only environment variable names logged for troubleshooting
- Log levels properly used (ERROR, WARNING, INFO, DEBUG)

## Recommendations for Deployment

1. **Environment Variables**: Always use environment variables for secrets, never hardcode in configuration files
2. **File Permissions**: Set restrictive permissions on config.yaml (e.g., `chmod 600 config.yaml`)
3. **Service Account**: Run the service under a dedicated user account with minimal privileges
4. **Network**: Use firewall rules to restrict MQTT connections to known hosts
5. **Updates**: Keep dependencies updated, especially security-critical ones like `faster-whisper` and `paho-mqtt`

## Verified Safe Practices

✅ No hardcoded credentials  
✅ Secrets via environment variables  
✅ Input sanitization for external processes  
✅ Timeout protection on subprocess calls  
✅ TLS/SSL for MQTT communication  
✅ Certificate validation enabled  
✅ Proper error handling without info leakage  
✅ Resource cleanup (files, streams, connections)  

## Conclusion

All CodeQL alerts are false positives related to logging environment variable names for user guidance. The actual sensitive values are never logged. The codebase follows security best practices for handling credentials, input validation, and secure communication.
